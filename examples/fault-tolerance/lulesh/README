This is the README for porting LULESH to LAIK


Building
========

Clone with "git clone --recurse ..." to also clone LAIK as submodule in subdirectory "laik/".
By default, this version will be linked with LULESH.
First, run "configure". MPI needs to be installed and detected for LULESH to work.

    cd laik
    ./configure
    make liblaik.so


To link LULESH with an existing LAIK installation, set LAIK_ROOT to the path you installed
LAIK into (or the base directory with the compiled LAIK sources).
    
To build LULESH, just run
    
    make

There are two targets for builing laik-lulesh: one that compiles it for best performance and 
the other one compiles it for enabling repartitioning.

for performance use the following build instruction: (default)
    make -DPERFORMANCE

for enabling repartitioning use:
    make -DREPARTITIONING
